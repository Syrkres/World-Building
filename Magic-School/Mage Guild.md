The school itself resides over a powerful [[Ley Lines]] Conjuction, which is deep below the school in secret chambers. Often only the Archmage and above have access to this and can draw power directly.

Students are required to contribute spells as part of the payment. Level of spells and caster level determines the benefits. 

Once you advance in rank at the school at some point you need to pledge your loyalty before you can advance any further.

Students and Faculty are also required to perform services, when required by the community.

## Ranking/Tender
The Mage school has a ranking system which basically gives you a "currency" referred to as "Tender" (what is your tender?). The higher ones Tender the higher your rank is and the more you get access to things.

When you first join, normally you pay a fee of 800gp, which gives you a starting Tender of 500. This of this as your cash value to buy "access" to things.  The seven ranks usually have a minimum Tender required to achieve that rank. 

Doing tasks (copying scrolls, books, research, quests) grant you Tender. The harder the task, the more Tender you are awarded. Higher ups will often give specific Tender rewards for doing specific tasks for them. 

Using some of the schools resources requires the spenditure of Tender. The Teleportation Circle access is one, though one can often pay gold for access (if it is available to non-school members)

### The Application Process
To be accepted into  University, applicants must meet at least two out of the following three requirements:

* ***Sponsorship.*** The applicant procures a letter of recommendation from a sponsor. Authorized nominating sponsors include nobles, other public officials or military officers of equivalent stature, spiritual hierarchs, and  professors. Sponsors may vet applicants extensively to determine who is worthy of sponsorship... or may instead cynically award them as favors for supporters who want to get their kids into .
* ***Personal Essay.*** The applicant writes an essay detailing their background, extracurricular pursuits, and reasons for wanting to attend. Any previous magical training an applicant has received is to be detailed in this essay, along with any requests for financial aid.
* ***Entrance Examination.*** The applicant must pass an entrance exam which tests their academic and magical aptitude. These assessments are administered by proctors either at the campus itself or sent out elsewhere.

An admissions review panel back  uses the above criteria in selecting who is to be admitted. All decisions are unanimous; a single vote of dissent is enough to disqualify an applicant. Indeed, only a tenth of applicants are granted admission into the prestigious university. While officials maintain the importance of maintaining strict standards on who is admitted, critics frequently accuse the application process of being rife with favoritism and of placing unnecessary roadblocks to more disadvantaged applicants.


## Tuition
Like most other academic institutions of its pedigree,  University charges students tuition to attend. A student’s tuition covers class enrollment fees, textbook costs, archive access, and living expenses for modest room and board. Tuition is paid on an annual basis, and is due the day classes begin. Costs for miscellaneous supplies such as paper, ink, and spell components are not covered by tuition.

Each academic year costs 800 gp, covering a time period of eight months. Over the course of four years, an undergraduate student can be expected to sink 3,200 gp into tuition costs. Again, this amount does not take personal supplies into account.
